    "The tax system has been replaced with a shiny new bracket system in the country of Oongland, and you've been asked by your family to compute the total earnings you will have during the year. The tax brackets are as follow:\n",

    "2. The taxes are per bracket. Eg if you make 18000 you pay 0% for the first 15000 and 10% on the remaining 3000. This way, you are never penalized for entering a higher tax bracket.\n",

    "You're in charge of generating data in a data warehouse based on inputs received from another source. In particular, you've been tasked with handling customer details in the form of generating a username for them based on 2 simple aspects: Their full name and their birth year. Suppose for simplicity that all users only use 1 first name and 1 surname.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you receive from the source is their full name, in a tuple (firstname, lastname) format, and their birth year as an integer. The values accepted are between 1911 and 2010, inclusive. The username generating method is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `firstname`: You only take the first letter, as uppercase\n",
    "- You add an underscore separator\n",
    "- `lastname`: You keep it as it is, except lowercase\n",
    "- `birth_year`: You add the final 2 digits of the birth year.\n",

    "> 1. Sometimes, usernames may overlap. For example **Ana Smith** born in **1990** and **Anastasia Smith** also born in **1990** would both have the username `A_smith90`. To avoid this, the system will send, if needed, an integer value in case the original username was already in the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is: If `A_smith90` was already in the system, you would instead receive the complete input:\n",
    "`[(Anastasia, Smith), 1990, 27]`. Adding *another underscore* in between, this would generate the username: `A_smith90_27`. You need not worry about username duplication, since the input will only send an additional integer (between 0 and 99 inclusive) if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. While the system works as intended, it sometimes shuffles the inputs...\n",
    "\n",
    "You ALWAYS receive 1 tuple of (`firstname`, `lastname`) and 1 *integer* between *1911 - 2010* (and *sometimes* a 3rd element, an *integer* between *0* and *99*) inside a list, but you don't always receive them in the same order. That is, the following inputs are all valid:\n",
